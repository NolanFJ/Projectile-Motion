# Projectile-Motion
This is a basic introduction to projectile motion. Students will become acquainted with principles such as the kinematic equations, graphing motion, and the difference between position, velocity, and acceleration. The script includes interactive graphics, example problems, and diagrams to help guide readers through new concepts and solidify them through practice. 
### Breakdown
The folder contains two main files:
 - The instructional script: [ProjectileMotionLiveScript.mlx](https://github.com/NolanFJ/Projectile-Motion/blob/main/ProjectileMotionLiveScript.mlx "ProjectileMotionLiveScript.mlx")
 - The solution script: [ProjectileMotionLiveScriptSOLUTION.mlx](https://github.com/NolanFJ/Projectile-Motion/blob/main/ProjectileMotionLiveScriptSOLUTION.mlx "ProjectileMotionLiveScriptSOLUTION.mlx")
# Instructions / Requirements

Jhanine Estigoy worked on the **Modeling Motion Using Kinematic Equations** section. This section covered the kinematic equations for horizontal and vertical motion while also briefly mentioning the sign convention of acceleration due to gravity which is covered more in depth in the next section. This section includes the definition of each variable and covers a projectile’s time of flight, range, and maximum height. Using these concepts, users will solve an exercise where they apply what they've learned to solve for a basketball’s time of flight, maximum height, and range.

Ben Choi worked on the **Signs, Conventions, and Graphing** section. This section covered what to expect when dealing with coordinate grids as well as the typical conventions for positive and negative directions. Students learn the basics of graphing motion in regards to position, velocity, and acceleration respectively in relation to time. By interacting with graphs, they will gain familiarity with the variables responsible for motion. 

Nolan Johnson worked on the **X and Y Components of Projectile Motion and the Effects of Gravity** section. This section goes over the general definition of projectile motion, the separation of components, and how gravity individually affects each of the components. The section utilizes a simple exercise and a graph animation that gives the user some interaction while going through the section.

Aaliyah Martinez worked on the **How are Position, Velocity and Acceleration Related** section which covered how calculus connects these three concepts. To help readers understand visually, this section included a graph and table explaining the math. There is also an interactive multiple choice question about the units of these components with hints and a solution. 

Everything else in the project was a shared effort by all four members.
